# Useful Links

The supermarket project doesn't have, AFAIK, useful walk-throughs. I hope to provide that here.

## Manual install

You don't want to do a manual install. Unless you're someone who wants to look under the covers before turning everything over to a cookbook.

Some assumptions:
* The GCE project `cheffian-supermarket` is my cloud, so FQDNs reflect this
* I've hacked my /etc/hosts to use `chefserver` and `supermarket` as the hostnames


## chefserver

Install and configure api_fqdn:

    apt-get update
    curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/chef/stable/script.deb |  bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install chef-server-core
    echo "api_fqdn \"$(hostname -f)\"" >> /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
    chef-server-ctl reconfigure

Add orgs/user:

    chef-server-ctl user-create pdb Peter Burkholder pburkholder@getchef.com TestPassword -f pdb.pem
    chef-server-ctl org-create pdb_chef12_org pdb_chef12_org -f pdb_chef12_org.pem -a pdb
    echo "oc_id['administrators'] = ['pdb']" >> /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
    chef-server-ctl reconfigure

Configure oc-id

* Navigate to https://chefserver/id
* Click the New Application button and fill in the application name and Redirect url
  * Name: supermarket
  * Redirect uri: https://<ip or name of supermarket server>/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    * e.g.:
          https://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
          http://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
* After you click Submit you will be shown the Application Id and Secret strings which you must supply to Supermarket.  Copy these down, but donâ€™t worry about losing them. You can always retrieve them from the /id/oauth/applications URL of your Chef server.



## Supermarket

Install:

    apt-get update
    curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/chef/stable/script.deb | apt-get update
    apt-get install supermarket
    supermarket-ctl reconfigure

Configure `/etc/supermarket/supermarket.rb`, with the app_id and secret from above:

    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_app_id'] = '1fcce03a...67b822d1196'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_secret'] = '9836e5f7d65....b10178ac0d'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_url'] = 'https://chefserver-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_verify_ssl'] = false


ALSO, you don't want to use self-signed certs, as Berkshelf has a hard time with that, so don't force ssl:

    default['supermarket']['nginx']['force_ssl'] = false

Reconfigure:

    supermarket-ctl reconfigure

Next:

https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/sign-in

You'll be redirected to the `oc-id` service on chef-server. Sign-in with the credentials you used above, then accept the request to 'Authorize Supermarket to use your Chef account'

You should be in.

## Now, let's move on to uploading cookbooks...


#### Notes

These are all the Callback URLs that I authorized above:

    https://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    http://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    http://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
