# Useful Links

The supermarket project doesn't have, AFAIK, useful walk-throughs. I hope to provide that here.

## Manual install

You don't want to do a manual install. Unless you're someone who wants to look under the covers before turning everything over to a cookbook.

Some assumptions:
* The GCE project `cheffian-supermarket` is my cloud, so FQDNs reflect this
* I've hacked my /etc/hosts to use `chefserver` and `supermarket` as the hostnames


## chefserver

Install and configure api_fqdn:

    apt-get update
    curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/chef/stable/script.deb |  bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get install chef-server-core
    echo "api_fqdn \"$(hostname -f)\"" >> /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
    chef-server-ctl reconfigure

Add orgs/user:

    chef-server-ctl user-create pdb Peter Burkholder pburkholder@getchef.com TestPassword -f pdb.pem
    chef-server-ctl org-create pdb_chef12_org pdb_chef12_org -f pdb_chef12_org.pem -a pdb
    echo "oc_id['administrators'] = ['pdb']" >> /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
    chef-server-ctl reconfigure

Configure oc-id

* Navigate to https://chefserver/id
* Click the New Application button and fill in the application name and Redirect url
  * Name: supermarket
  * Redirect uri: https://<ip or name of supermarket server>/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    * e.g.:
          https://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
          http://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
* After you click Submit you will be shown the Application Id and Secret strings which you must supply to Supermarket.  Copy these down, but donâ€™t worry about losing them. You can always retrieve them from the /id/oauth/applications URL of your Chef server.



## Supermarket

Install:

    apt-get update
    curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/chef/stable/script.deb | apt-get update
    apt-get install supermarket
    supermarket-ctl reconfigure

Configure `/etc/supermarket/supermarket.rb`, with the app_id and secret from above:

    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_app_id'] = '1fcce03a...67b822d1196'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_secret'] = '9836e5f7d65....b10178ac0d'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_url'] = 'https://chefserver-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal'
    default['supermarket']['chef_oauth2_verify_ssl'] = false


ALSO, you don't want to use self-signed certs, as Berkshelf has a hard time with that, so don't force ssl:

    default['supermarket']['nginx']['force_ssl'] = false

Reconfigure:

    supermarket-ctl reconfigure

Next:

https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/sign-in

You'll be redirected to the `oc-id` service on chef-server. Sign-in with the credentials you used above, then accept the request to 'Authorize Supermarket to use your Chef account'

You should be in.

## Now, let's move on to uploading cookbooks...


#### Notes

## ssl testing

Even with ssl.verify off, `berks install` or `berks vendor` will fail when supermarket is using a self-signed certificate. So, how do we get around that?

Got /var/opt/supermarket/ssl/cacert.pem into local cacert.pem. I hacked my /etc/hosts to resolve supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal

### Get the CERT


    knife ssl fetch supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal
    # concatenate all your pems
    cd ....chef/trusted_certs
    cat &star.crt > cacert.pem

### openssl s_client

Cert verify with `openssl`

    openssl s_client -CAfile cacert.pem -connect supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal:443 -verify 0


### Faraday

But curl doesn't matter, since Berkshelf uses Faraday, so let's try with that:

    require 'faraday'
    print "Trying with no ssl options:\n"
    begin
        connection = Faraday::Connection.new 'https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal'
        p connection.get '/universe'
        p "WORKED\n\n\n"
    rescue Exception => e
        print e.message, "\n\n\n"
    end

    print "Trying with ssl ca_file options:\n"
    begin
        connection = Faraday::Connection.new 'https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal', :ssl => { :ca_file => './cacert.pem' }
        p connection.get '/universe'
        p "WORKED\n\n\n"
    rescue Exception => e
        print e.message, "\n\n\n"
    end

###  Berks

However, Berks doesn't have any options for specifying CA_file.  Hmmmm. Good news, the above script works when:

    export SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem

Now attempts to use `berks` with the same SSL_CERT_FILE path set will work.

    berks vendor

should work.


### Berksfile?

Add this to your Berskfile:

    ENV['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = '/some/path/to/cacert.pem'


### Aside: Cert verify with `curl`

I can't get curl to work with self-signed cert, so don't count on Curl for helping you here. You'd think the following would work:

    curl -v --cacert cacert.pem https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal:443

But it doesn't. It would seem that since self-signed certs don't assert themselves as CAs that curl won't be happy (and probably berks neither). That is, that

    openssl x509 -in cacert.pem -inform pem -text -out certdata

won't contain:

    X509v3 Basic Constraints:
    CA:TRUE
    X509v3 Key Usage:
    Certificate Sign, CRL Sign

## callback notes

These are all the Callback URLs that I authorized above:

    https://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    http://supermarket/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    http://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/auth/chef_oauth2/callback
    https://supermarket-0.c.cheffian-supermarket.internal/auth/chef_oauth2/callback




# How it all fits together!

https://github.com/chef/omnibus-supermarket/blob/master/cookbooks/omnibus-supermarket/attributes/default.rb

Becomes /etc/supermarket/supermarket.rb

So, after you install omnibus-supermarket, you'll want a cookbook to
use the modify supermarket.rb

Wrap, wrap, baby???

The things to address are:
- ssl cert
- features -- currybot?
